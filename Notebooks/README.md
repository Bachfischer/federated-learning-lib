# IBMFL tutorials and Demos

In this directory, we have a collection of jupyter notebooks to demonstrate how to use IBM FL to run some of our examples.

* [Training a Keras CNN model on MNIST dataset](./keras_classifier)
* [Mitigating bias of the global model on Adult dataset via local reweighing](./sklearn_logclassification_rw)
* [Trying out a cartpole reinforcement learning example](./cartpole/cartpole.ipynb)
